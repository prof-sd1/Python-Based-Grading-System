# 🧮 Python Grading System

A simple yet powerful Python-based grading system for evaluating student marks across multiple subjects. This project collects student names, their subject-wise scores, computes the total, average, and assigns letter grades.

## 🚀 Features

- Input-based grading for multiple students and subjects  
- Automatic calculation of total and average  
- Letter grade assignment based on average  
- Console-based tabular report card output  
- Clean and fully commented codebase  
- Easily extensible (e.g., CSV export, GUI, web app)

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user enters:
   - Number of students
   - Number of subjects
   - Names of subjects
2. For each student:
   - Name and marks in each subject are entered
   - Total and average marks are calculated
   - A letter grade (A+ to F) is assigned
3. A clean report card is displayed in the terminal.
